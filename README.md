# Weather Dashboard - Command-Line Tool Using Python

A Python-based command-line tool that fetches and displays current weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. This project demonstrates the use of APIs, JSON data handling, and basic error management in Python.

## Features
- Fetch current weather data for any city.
- Display temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed.
- Handle errors gracefully, including invalid city names and network issues.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Requests Library for API calls
- OpenWeatherMap API

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3 installed on your machine.
- Pip (Python package installer) installed.

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-dashboard.git
   cd weather-dashboard
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

4. **Get Your API Key**
   - Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) to get a free API key.
   - Replace `'your_openweathermap_api_key'` in the script with your actual API key.

## Usage
1. **Run the Program**
   ```bash
   python weather_dashboard.py
   ```

2. **Input a City**
   - When prompted, enter the name of the city you want to get weather data for.
   - The tool will display the current temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed for the specified city.

3. **Exit the Program**
   - Type `'exit'` when prompted to quit the program.

### Example
```plaintext
Welcome to the Weather Dashboard!
Enter the name of the city (or 'exit' to quit): London

Weather in London:
Temperature: 15°C
Condition: Light rain
Humidity: 80%
Wind Speed: 5 m/s

Enter the name of the city (or 'exit' to quit): exit
```

## Error Handling
- If you enter a city name that does not exist, the program will notify you that the city was not found.
- If there are any network issues, the program will inform you of the error and suggest checking your connection.

## Future Improvements
- Add the ability to fetch weather forecasts.
- Support multiple units (metric, imperial).
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
